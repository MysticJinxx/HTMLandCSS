		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Here is a brief summary of the Husky quoted from Britannica:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/animal/Siberian-husky">
			Siberian Husky, breed of working dog raised in Siberia by the Chukchi people, who valued it as a sled dog and companion.
			It was brought to Alaska in 1909 for sled dog races and soon became established as a consistent winner. 
			In 1925 the breed gained widespread fame by saving Nome, Alaska, during a diphtheria epidemic;
			teams of Siberian Huskies battled blizzard conditions to relay life-saving serum over 674 miles (1,085 km) to the icebound city.
