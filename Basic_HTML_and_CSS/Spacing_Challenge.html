			<h1>HOMEWORK MACHINE</h1>
				<p>
					The Homework Machine, oh the Homework Machine,<br>
					Most perfect contraption that's ever been seen.<br>
					Just put in your homework, then drop in a dime,<br>
					Snap on the switch, and in ten seconds' time,<br>
					Your homework comes out, quick and clean as can be.<br>
					Here it is--"nine plus four?" and the andswer is "three."<br>
					Three?<br>
					Oh me ...<br>
					I guess it's not as perfect<br>
					As I thought it would be.
